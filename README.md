# datocms-codegen-imgix-repro

## Description

-   We generate typescript types and a request SDK from Dato's GQL schema using `graphql-codegen`, `typescript-operations` and `typescript-graphql-request`
-   In order to have stricter types we use the new `X-Exclude-Invalid` header in conjunction with `avoidOptionals`

â†’ **Result:** The type for `ImgixParams` is too strict, since all of the properties that are possible as imgix params are resolved as required.

## Reproduce

Should work on any DatoCMS project.

```sh
$ npm install
$ DATOCMS_API_TOKEN_READONLY=<TOKEN> npm run build
$ npm test
```
